## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-10

### Added

#### Developer Experience Metrics System
- **DevExperienceMetrics**: Comprehensive developer experience measurement and reporting system
  - IDE performance measurement (type checking, autocomplete, navigation, IntelliSense)
  - Workflow timing analysis (hot reload, build startup, testing, linting, formatting)
  - Productivity metrics calculation (compile time, error resolution, refactoring efficiency)
  - Intelligent scoring system (0-100) with weighted metrics
  - Automated optimization recommendations

- **IDEPerformanceAnalyzer**: Detailed IDE performance analysis and benchmarking
  - TypeScript compilation and type checking performance measurement
  - Autocomplete response time and accuracy analysis
  - Code navigation speed measurement (go to definition, find references, symbol search)
  - IntelliSense performance analysis (hover info, signature help, diagnostics)
  - Workspace complexity analysis and optimization suggestions
  - Comprehensive performance scoring and recommendations

- **ProductivityTracker**: Development workflow and productivity tracking system
  - Session-based activity tracking (coding, debugging, testing, building, refactoring, researching)
  - Build and test event recording with success/failure tracking
  - Code change metrics (lines changed, files modified)
  - Productivity trends analysis (daily/weekly patterns)
  - Automated report generation with actionable insights
  - Data persistence in `.kiro/productivity-data/` directory

#### CLI Tools
- **dev-experience-cli**: Comprehensive command-line interface for developer experience metrics
  - `analyze`: Run comprehensive developer experience analysis
  - `benchmark`: Run IDE performance benchmark
  - `track`: Start productivity tracking session
  - `report [days]`: Generate productivity report for specified time period

#### New Package Scripts
- `dx:analyze`: Run developer experience analysis
- `dx:benchmark`: Run IDE performance benchmark
- `dx:track`: Start productivity tracking session
- `dx:report`: Generate productivity report

#### Documentation
- **README-dev-experience.md**: Comprehensive documentation for the developer experience metrics system
- Updated main README.md with developer experience metrics integration
- Added API reference documentation for all new components
- Added usage examples and integration guides

#### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 25+ tests covering all developer experience components
- Mock implementations for testing environments
- Performance measurement validation tests
- Productivity tracking workflow tests

### Enhanced

#### Main Package
- Updated main index.ts to export all developer experience components
- Added new package.json exports for developer experience modules
- Enhanced TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

#### Integration
- Seamless integration with existing validation framework
- Compatible with CI/CD pipelines
- Support for automated reporting and trend analysis

### Technical Details

#### Metrics Collected
- **IDE Performance**: TypeScript compilation (ms), autocomplete response (ms), navigation speed (ms), IntelliSense latency (ms)
- **Workflow Timing**: Hot reload (ms), build startup (ms), test execution (ms), linting (ms), formatting (ms)
- **Productivity**: Session duration (ms), coding efficiency (%), debugging ratio (%), build success rate (%), test success rate (%)

#### Scoring Algorithm
- Weighted scoring system with configurable thresholds
- IDE Performance: 40% weight (TypeScript 30%, Autocomplete 25%, Navigation 25%, IntelliSense 20%)
- Workflow Performance: 35% weight (equal distribution across metrics)
- Productivity: 25% weight (equal distribution across metrics)

#### Data Storage
- Local data storage in `.kiro/productivity-data/` directory
- JSON format for session data and trends
- Configurable data retention policies
- Privacy-focused (no external data transmission)

#### Requirements Satisfied
- **Requirement 2.4**: IDE performance measurement and analysis tools ✅
- **Requirement 2.4**: Development workflow timing and efficiency metrics ✅
- **Requirement 2.5**: Developer productivity measurement and reporting system ✅
