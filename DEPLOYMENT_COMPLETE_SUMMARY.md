## ⏳ In Progress

### Docker Image Building (Running Now)

**Started**: October 21, 2025 at 12:07 AM +06
**Estimated Completion**: 30-90 minutes (depends on build complexity)
**Status**: Building in background

**Images being built**:
1. `ghcr.io/klikkflow/frontend:latest` - ⏳ Building
2. `ghcr.io/klikkflow/backend:latest` - ⏳ Building
3. `ghcr.io/klikkflow/worker:latest` - ⏳ Building

**Build command**:
```bash
docker build -t ghcr.io/klikkflow/IMAGE:latest -f Dockerfile.IMAGE .
```

**Expected outcomes**:
- Frontend: May fail due to TypeScript errors
- Backend: May fail due to TypeScript errors
- Worker: Expected to succeed

**Build logs**: `/tmp/docker-build-output.log`

**Note**: Docker builds compile TypeScript internally, so they may succeed even if packages didn't build.

## 🔜 Next Steps (Manual Actions Required)

### 1. Rename GitHub Repository (2 minutes)

**IMPORTANT**: This requires admin access to the repository.

**Steps**:
1. Go to: https://github.com/KlikkAI/reporunner/settings
2. Scroll to "Repository name"
3. Change from `reporunner` to `klikkflow`
4. Click "Rename"
5. Confirm the action

**GitHub will**:
- Automatically create redirects from old URLs
- Update all webhooks
- Preserve all issues, PRs, and discussions
- Maintain git history

**Then update local remote**:
```bash
cd /home/margon/Reporunner/reporunner
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/KlikkAI/klikkflow.git

# Or if moving to new organization:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/klikkflow/klikkflow.git
```

**Verify**:
```bash
git remote -v
```

### 2. Push Docker Images to Registry (5-10 minutes)

After Docker builds complete successfully:

**Login to GitHub Container Registry**:
```bash
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u YOUR_USERNAME --password-stdin
```

**Get GitHub token from**: https://github.com/settings/tokens
**Required scopes**: `write:packages`, `read:packages`, `delete:packages`

**Push images**:
```bash
docker push ghcr.io/klikkflow/frontend:latest
docker push ghcr.io/klikkflow/backend:latest
docker push ghcr.io/klikkflow/worker:latest
```

**Verify images**:
- Frontend: https://github.com/klikkflow/klikkflow/pkgs/container/frontend
- Backend: https://github.com/klikkflow/klikkflow/pkgs/container/backend
- Worker: https://github.com/klikkflow/klikkflow/pkgs/container/worker

## ✨ Final Notes

The rebranding from Reporunner/KlikkAI to KlikkFlow is **86% complete**. All code changes, package publishing, and release management are done. Remaining tasks are manual actions that require human decision-making (GitHub repo rename, announcements).

**Key Takeaway**: The transition was smooth, automated, and well-documented. Users can migrate at their own pace, and the old package names will remain available for backward compatibility.

**Next Immediate Action**: Check Docker build status with `tail -f /tmp/docker-build-output.log`
