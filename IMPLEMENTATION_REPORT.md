- AuditService        // Compliance and audit logging
- TenantService       // Multi-tenancy management
- NotificationService // Alert and notification handling
```

#### 2. Service Discovery & Communication Layer
```yaml
# Recommended: Implement service mesh
- Technology: Istio or Consul Connect
- Features needed:
  - Service registry
  - Load balancing
  - Circuit breaking
  - Distributed tracing
  - mTLS between services
```

#### 3. API Gateway Implementation
```typescript
// Gateway requirements:
- Rate limiting per tenant
- Request/response transformation
- Authentication/authorization
- Request routing
- API versioning
- WebSocket support for real-time features
```

### Medium Priority (3-6 months)

#### 4. Testing Infrastructure

// Current coverage: ~30% → Target: 80%
- Unit tests for all services
- Integration tests for workflows
- E2E tests for critical paths
- Performance benchmarks
- Load testing scenarios
```

#### 5. Documentation Portal
```markdown
# Documentation needs:
- API reference (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Getting started guides
- Architecture documentation
- Deployment guides
- SDK documentation
- Video tutorials
```

#### 6. Monitoring & Observability
```yaml
# Stack to implement:
- Metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- Tracing: Jaeger or Zipkin
- APM: New Relic or DataDog
- Alerting: PagerDuty integration
```

### Low Priority (6-12 months)

#### 7. Advanced Features
- AI-powered workflow suggestions
- Natural language workflow creation
- Advanced scheduling with timezone support
- Workflow marketplace
- Plugin system for custom nodes
- Mobile applications (React Native)

#### 8. Infrastructure Automation
```yaml
# Kubernetes deployment:
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: workflow-service
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: workflow-service
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: workflow-service
        image: reporunner/workflow-service:latest
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "256Mi"
            cpu: "250m"
          limits:
            memory: "512Mi"
            cpu: "500m"
```

## Optimization Recommendations

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Optimization**
```javascript
// Implement connection pooling
const mongoOptions = {
  minPoolSize: 10,
  maxPoolSize: 50,
  serverSelectionTimeoutMS: 5000,
};

// Add read replicas for analytics
const readPreference = ReadPreference.SECONDARY_PREFERRED;
```

2. **Caching Strategy**
```typescript
// Multi-layer caching
- L1: In-memory cache (Node.js process)
- L2: Redis cache (shared)
- L3: CDN for static assets
```

3. **Query Optimization**
```javascript
// Use aggregation pipelines
db.workflows.aggregate([
  { $match: { organizationId: orgId } },
  { $lookup: { from: 'executions', ... } },
  { $group: { _id: '$status', count: { $sum: 1 } } }
]);
```

### Architecture Improvements

1. **Implement CQRS Pattern**
```typescript
// Separate read and write models
interface WorkflowWriteModel {
  create(workflow: CreateWorkflowDto): Promise<void>;
  update(id: string, changes: UpdateWorkflowDto): Promise<void>;
}

interface WorkflowReadModel {
  findById(id: string): Promise<WorkflowView>;
  search(query: SearchQuery): Promise<WorkflowView[]>;
}
```

2. **Event Sourcing for Audit Trail**
```typescript
interface WorkflowEvent {
  aggregateId: string;
  eventType: 'Created' | 'Updated' | 'Executed' | 'Deleted';
  eventData: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  userId: string;
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

### Phase 1: Development Environment
```bash
# Docker Compose for local development
docker-compose up -d mongodb redis postgres
npm run dev:services
```

### Phase 2: Staging Environment
```yaml
# Kubernetes staging deployment
kubectl apply -f k8s/staging/
kubectl rollout status deployment/workflow-service
```

### Phase 3: Production Rollout
```bash
# Blue-green deployment
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --strategy=blue-green
```
