# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Phase A: Validation & Optimization focuses on ensuring the recently consolidated package architecture works correctly and delivers the expected performance improvements. This phase validates that the 58.6% package reduction (from 29 to 12 packages) has been successful and identifies opportunities for further optimization. The goal is to establish a solid foundation before moving to feature development phases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Validation

**User Story:** As a developer working with the consolidated codebase, I want comprehensive validation that all functionality works correctly after consolidation, so that I can confidently build new features on the clean architecture.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the full test suite is executed THEN the system SHALL pass all existing tests without failures
2. WHEN API endpoints are tested THEN the system SHALL respond correctly with expected data and status codes
3. WHEN frontend functionality is tested end-to-end THEN the system SHALL demonstrate all user workflows work as expected
4. WHEN build processes are executed THEN the system SHALL complete successfully without errors or warnings
5. IF any test failures are discovered THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution paths

### Requirement 2: Performance Analysis and Measurement

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want to measure and document the performance improvements from consolidation, so that I can validate the consolidation benefits and identify further optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN build times are measured THEN the system SHALL demonstrate at least 30% improvement over pre-consolidation baseline
2. WHEN bundle sizes are analyzed THEN the system SHALL show at least 20% reduction in total bundle size
3. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL report current usage patterns and identify optimization opportunities
4. WHEN development experience metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL document improvements in IDE performance and developer productivity
5. IF performance targets are not met THEN the system SHALL provide actionable recommendations for optimization

### Requirement 3: Developer Experience Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer using the consolidated packages, I want improved development tools and workflows, so that I can be more productive and write better code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using TypeScript autocomplete THEN the system SHALL provide accurate and fast suggestions from consolidated packages
2. WHEN navigating code in IDE THEN the system SHALL enable quick navigation between related components across packages
3. WHEN importing from packages THEN the system SHALL use streamlined import paths that are intuitive and consistent
4. WHEN debugging applications THEN the system SHALL provide clear stack traces and source mapping
5. WHEN working with shared types THEN the system SHALL ensure type safety across all package boundaries

### Requirement 4: Architecture Validation

**User Story:** As a software architect, I want to validate that the consolidated architecture follows best practices and supports future scalability, so that the codebase remains maintainable as it grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing package dependencies THEN the system SHALL show no circular dependencies between packages
2. WHEN reviewing code organization THEN the system SHALL demonstrate clear separation of concerns across packages
3. WHEN examining shared utilities THEN the system SHALL show no duplicate code or conflicting implementations
4. WHEN validating type definitions THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent interfaces across all packages
5. IF architectural issues are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific recommendations for resolution

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

**User Story:** As a team member joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation of the new architecture and validation results, so that I can quickly understand the system and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing architecture documentation THEN the system SHALL provide clear diagrams and explanations of package relationships
2. WHEN reviewing validation results THEN the system SHALL present performance metrics and test outcomes in an understandable format
3. WHEN following setup instructions THEN the system SHALL enable new developers to get the project running quickly
4. WHEN looking for troubleshooting guidance THEN the system SHALL provide common issues and solutions
5. WHEN seeking best practices THEN the system SHALL document recommended patterns for working with the consolidated architecture
