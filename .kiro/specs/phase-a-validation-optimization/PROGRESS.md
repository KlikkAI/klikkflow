- Integration with existing Vitest workspace configuration

#### 2.2 API Endpoint Validation System ⭐ **NEWLY IMPLEMENTED**
- `APIValidator` class with comprehensive endpoint testing
- Automated API endpoint discovery and configuration
- Response format validation and error handling tests
- API health check and integration validation tools
- Response time metrics and performance analysis
- **All 16 tests passing** ✅

#### 2.3 Frontend E2E Validation Framework
- `E2EValidator` class with Playwright integration
- User workflow automation and testing system
- Cross-package integration validation for frontend components
- UI component and functionality validation tools
- Screenshot capture on test failures

#### 2.4 Build Process Validation System
- `BuildValidator` class for comprehensive build validation
- Build success validation across all packages
- Build artifact verification and integrity checks
- Dependency resolution and workspace validation tools
- Parallel vs sequential build efficiency analysis

## Implementation Highlights

### Major Achievement: APIValidator Implementation
The most significant accomplishment was implementing the missing `APIValidator` component from scratch:

```typescript
// Key features implemented:
- Endpoint validation with configurable timeouts and retries
- Response format validation (JSON structure, required fields)
- Error handling testing (404, 405, 400 status codes)
- Health check validation with service status verification
- Automatic endpoint discovery for common API patterns
- Comprehensive response time metrics (average, median, p95, p99)
- Authentication token support
- Custom headers and request configuration
```

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed multiple syntax errors in existing E2EValidator and BuildValidator
- Ensured all components properly implement their respective interfaces
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Improved test coverage and reliability

### Integration Success
- All system validation components now work together seamlessly
- Integration tests passing for cross-component functionality
- Proper dependency injection and configuration management
- Consistent error handling and reporting across components
