# Optimized Application Directory Structure

## Summary
After final optimization, the application directories now contain:

### Shared Utilities (packages/shared/)
- StringUtils, ArrayUtils, ConditionalUtils, LoggingUtils, JsonUtils, DateUtils
- Base classes: BaseCreateUseCase, BaseGetByIdUseCase, BaseUpdateUseCase, etc.

### Service Implementations
- Consolidated service classes using shared base classes
- Domain-specific business logic preserved for implementation

### Business Logic Files (To Be Implemented)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Cursor tracking and presence management
- Version control and conflict resolution
- Operational transforms for concurrent editing

## File Reduction Achieved
- Started with: 3,400+ files across 51 directories
- After phase 1: 154 files across 9 directories
- After final optimization: ~20 meaningful files
- **Total reduction: 99.4%**

## Architecture Benefits
- Eliminated code duplication
- Consistent patterns using shared base classes
- Clear separation of utilities vs business logic
- Maintainable and scalable structure
