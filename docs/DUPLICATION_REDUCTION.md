# Duplication Reduction Plan

## Current State
- Total duplication rate: 11.73%
- Files analyzed: 774
- Total clones found: 555
- Duplicated lines: 14,459 (11.73% of total)
- Duplicated tokens: 116,148 (12.39% of total)

## High Priority Areas

### 1. Frontend Components
Major duplications found in:
- WorkflowEditor components
- Node-related components (NodeHandle, NodeBadge, etc.)
- Property renderers and panels
- UI components like EnhancedNodeToolbar

Action Items:
1. Create a shared component library for common UI elements
2. Extract shared logic into hooks and utilities
3. Implement a proper component composition pattern
4. Create higher-order components for common functionality

### 2. Service Layer
Duplications in:
- Core services (WorkflowService, CredentialService, etc.)
- Integration services
- Authentication and authorization services

Action Items:
1. Create base service classes with common functionality
2. Implement proper inheritance hierarchy
3. Extract shared utilities and helpers
4. Use composition over inheritance where applicable

### 3. Repository Layer
Identical patterns in:
- Repository implementations
- Data access patterns
- Error handling
- Validation logic

Action Items:
1. Create a generic repository base class
2. Implement shared query builders
3. Standardize error handling
4. Create common validation utilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Set up shared libraries structure
2. Create base classes and utilities
3. Document patterns and best practices
4. Set up automated checks for duplications

### Phase 2: Frontend Cleanup (Week 3-4)
1. Refactor WorkflowEditor components
2. Create shared UI component library
3. Implement proper component composition
4. Update documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Backend Cleanup (Week 5-6)
1. Implement base service classes
2. Refactor repository layer
3. Standardize error handling
4. Update tests and documentation

### Phase 4: Final Pass (Week 7-8)
1. Address remaining duplications
2. Validate changes
3. Update documentation
4. Release and monitor

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Set up regular duplication checks (weekly)
2. Monitor performance impacts
3. Update coding guidelines
4. Regular code reviews focusing on duplication

## Success Metrics

1. Reduce overall duplication to under 5%
2. No single file should have more than 10% duplication
3. Improved code maintainability scores
4. Reduced bundle sizes
5. Faster build times

## Risk Mitigation

1. Comprehensive test coverage before refactoring
2. Gradual rollout of changes
3. Regular backups and version control
4. Monitoring of performance metrics
