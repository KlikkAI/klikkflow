**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Intelligence scoring algorithm
const finalScore =
  distanceScore * 0.4 +
  directionScore * 0.2 +
  availabilityScore * 0.3 +
  typeScore * 0.1;

// Smart position optimization
const optimizedPosition = intelligentAutoConnect.findOptimalDropPosition(
  position,
  localNodes,
  targetNode,
);

- **AI-assisted suggestions** for property configuration
- **Resizable panels** for optimal workspace utilization

**Technical Implementation**:

```typescript
// Advanced property evaluation
const { evaluations, validateAll } = useEnhancedPropertyEvaluator(
  properties, formState, executionContext
);

// Three-column layout
<InputDataPanel width={700} />      // Connected node data
<ConfigurationPanel width={550} />  // Dynamic properties
<OutputPreviewPanel width={400} />  // Real-time results
```

**User Benefits**:
